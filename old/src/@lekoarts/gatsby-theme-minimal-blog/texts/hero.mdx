My name is Christine Seibert, and I am running for NH State Representative (Hillsborough District 21) in Manchester Ward 1.  

In my many years as an activist, I have learned how important it is that a representative is engaged, responsive, and hardworking. As your representative in Manchester, I pledge to listen to your concerns and fight for these issues, your issues, like I always have.

I will do the following throughout my time in office, when elected:

##### Listen and work for _YOU_
- Always be available to respond to your questions and concerns in a timely manner
- Elevate the voices of our community's marginalized residents
- Work to ensure that every citizen can easily exercise their right to vote

##### Stand up for your Quality of Life
- Seek a local, inclusive economy that puts working families first
- Fight to secure good housing, public education, healthcare, and childcare for all
- Guaranteed services for seniors, the physically and mentally disabled
- Support common sense gun reform

##### Fight for a better New Hampshire
- Improved transportation options including a rail link to Nashua, the Airport, and Boston
- Demand the clean air and water we all deserve, as well as a transition to renewable energy
- Just redistricting along with a fair and balanced budget
- Work to address income and wealth inequalities

Let me be your voice in the New Hampshire State House for Manchester, Ward 1.
