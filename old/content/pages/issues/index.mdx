All of us in New Hampshire want to live in a community where anyone can thrive, no matter who we are or where we come from. That means we need to secure affordable childcare and healthcare, strengthen our public schools, and address income and wealth inequality in our neighborhoods.


#### Health Care for All

- Build a public mandate for a Medicare for All system which covers dental, hearing, eye care, mental health, and pre-existing conditions.
- Work to implement a humane harm-reduction approach to addressing the opioid crisis.
- Protect the gains made by the Affordable Care Act.
- something something seniors
- something something physically & mentally disabled
- something for homeless & unemployed
- Planned Parenthood?

#### Strong Public Education

- Resist attempts to hijack our public education tax dollars & divert them to private & religious schools.
- Work to change our current property tax system of funding schools in favor of a more equitable school funding system.
- Push for debt-free higher education opportunities.
- something something trade schools & non-traditional training programs

#### A Fair Economy for All

- We need a livable minimum wage that provides enough money for workers to afford to live in New Hampshire.
    (mention fight for 15?)
- We will work to enact paid family and medical leave as a statewide public program to protect our working families during illness or the birth of a new child.
- something something universal childcare
- infrastructure ( roads, bridges, commuter rail and broadband internet )
- stand with workers
- something about housing

#### Rethink our Unbalanced Tax System
- revisit tax reform to promote New Hampshire businesses and confront wealth inequality
- tax on marijuana
- lower property taxes?
- earmark Keno & lottery $ for education?

#### Jobs, Justice, and Climate

- something something public transportation & trains
- Fight the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure and push greater investment in renewable energy.
    (mention coal?)
    (mention clean air & water?)
- Work to empower our communities to move toward a 100 percent renewable energy economy, prioritizing opportunities for local energy ownership, good union jobs, and democratic participation as we transition away from fossil fuels.
- Green New Deal

#### Campaign Finance Reform

- No Outside Money: Participating candidates should not accept donations from individuals residing outside New Hampshire and would request that so-called “independent groups” not spend money on their behalf; only citizens eligible to vote for the candidate would be allowed to contribute to his/her campaign 
- No Corporate Contributions: prevent non-persons like corporations, unions, and other special interests from funding political campaigns 
- Full Transparency: Candidates and political committee campaigning in New Hampshire would be required to regularly and publicly disclose their donors online

#### Voter Accessibility
- Make Democratic Party more inclusive
- Automatic registration?
- Fight barriers to voting like student ID laws, etc.
- no gerrymandering

- I’m fighting for women and girls.  Equality – or, rather, the lack of equality – hurts EVERYONE, and I find that a number of the causes that I think are most important – access to healthcare (including abortion services), social safety net programs, education, pay equity, and programs that address violence – are important to all of us, but are important to women in particular.
- I’m fighting for workers.  I love the idea of unions and think that, ethically administrated, unions are desperately necessary, particularly in the business environment as we currently practice it.
- I’m fighting for immigrants.  I’m sick to death of the scapegoating and defamation of people who come here looking for a better life.  If we’re going to claim to be Americans, we had better fucking step up and start living our political creed.
- I’m fighting for poor people.  Poverty is, as Gandhi told us, is the worst form of violence.  Demeaning and undercutting poor people has become a national pastime, and I’m beyond disgusted by it.
- I’m fighting for gun safety and a rational expression of our Second Amendment rights.  If we can’t admit that we’re WAY past crazy about the way we (don’t) deal with our gun problem, then we’re already doomed.
- I’m fighting for education.  We do education completely fucking WRONG in this country.  We take exactly ZERO heed to children’s developmental stages; if we did, elementary kids wouldn’t sit in desks, high schools wouldn’t start until 10 am, and everyone would still be learning art and music and having recess.  We’re far more interested in tests and data than is even remotely useful (or sane).  We disrespect teachers in more ways than I care to articulate here, we let our schools literally crumble around our students, and we saddle our college graduates with crushing debt.  Completely.  Fucking.  WRONG.
- I’m fighting for equal rights for my LGBTQ brothers and sisters and non-binary fam.
- I’m fighting for justice and equality for my African American (or, Black, if you prefer) brothers and sisters (and for my Hispanic, Native American, and differently-abled brothers and sisters).
- I’m fighting for basic human dignity, ethics, and transparency in our politics and policies, both local and national.  I’m fighting to make our police forces more about service and less about suspicion and aggression.  I’m fighting to keep us out of the warmongering business and to push us into the humanitarian business.
- I’m fighting against the patriarchy everywhere I see it – I challenge advertising, stereotypes, bigotry and misogyny every chance I get.
- I’m fighting for the environment; for clean air, water, and land; and safer food for everyone.
- I’m fighting for our individual right to make decisions about our end-of-life journey.
- I’m fighting for a better life – safer, more prosperous, more compassionate – for every human on earth.
