As an At-Large Member of the NH House Progressive Caucus, I tracked our members' votes for
leadership to identify new members and ensure the integrity of progressives in the State House.

As a member of the
[State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?id=16),
I fought hard to support our Veterans, National Guard, and other military or veterans' organizations
within the state. This is personal for me, coming from a Veteran household and family where both my
Father (US Army Veteran) and Husband (US Navy Veteran) proudly served our country. While we may
disagree on wars and how we got there, we still owe it to our Veterans to take care of them.

Collectively, as [NH House Democrats](https://nhhousedems.org/), we have accomplished some great
wins this last session, including but not limited to:

- **PASSED** Bail Reform: [HB 318](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=435&inflect=2)
- **DEFEATED** a Book Ban: [HB 1419](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1471&inflect=2)
- **PASSED** PFAS Regulations: [HB 1649](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1894&inflect=2)
- **DEFEATED** Universal School Vouchers [HB 331](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2023&id=203&txtFormat=html) and [HB 1634](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1890&inflect=2)
- **DEFEATED** Multiple Abortion Bans: [HB 591](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2023&id=265&txtFormat=html), [HB 1248](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1299&inflect=2), and [HB 1541](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1589&inflect=2)

We still have more work to do, and I look forward to continuing to listen to you and fighting for
you in the **New Hampshire House of Representatives** for another term!
